# Twitter Data Pipeline using Airflow

This project demonstrates the implementation of a data pipeline for extracting and processing Twitter data using Apache Airflow. The pipeline fetches tweets from the Twitter API, performs data preprocessing, and stores the processed data in a database.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Apache Airflow
- Python 3.x
- Twitter Developer Account with API credentials
- Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

## Installation

**Step 1:** Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-data-pipeline.git

Step 2: Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Configure Airflow

Update the airflow.cfg file with your configuration settings.
Set the dags_folder parameter in the airflow.cfg file to the path of the cloned repository.
Step 4: Configure Twitter API credentials

Create a Twitter Developer Account (if you haven't already) and create an application to obtain your API credentials.
Update the twitter_credentials.json file with your Twitter API credentials.
Step 5: Configure the database connection

Update the database_credentials.json file with your database connection details.
Step 6: Initialize the database

Run the following command to initialize the database:
airflow initdb

Usage
Start the Airflow web server:
airflow webserver

Start the Airflow scheduler:
airflow scheduler

Access the Airflow web interface:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

Enable the Twitter data pipeline DAG:
In the Airflow web interface, click on "DAGs" in the top navigation menu.
Find the twitter_data_pipeline DAG and toggle the switch to enable it.
Trigger the DAG:
Click on the play button (â–¶) next to the twitter_data_pipeline DAG to manually trigger it.
You can also set up a schedule or configure other triggers based on your requirements.
Customization
Feel free to customize the pipeline based on your specific use case. Some possible enhancements could include:

Adding additional data preprocessing steps (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling).
Storing the processed data in a different type of database (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch).
Incorporating data visualization or reporting tools to analyze the Twitter data.
